# NoteCast

Turns your NotebookLM audio overviews into a personal podcast feed.

> **Disclaimer:** NoteCast uses [notebooklm-py](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py), an **unofficial** reverse-engineered client for NotebookLM. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google. Use at your own risk — Google may change their API or ToS at any time.

## How it works

```
NotebookLM → notebooklm-py → harvester.py → MP3 → RSS feed → Caddy (HTTPS)
```

`notecast-bridge` polls all your notebooks every 5 minutes, downloads new audio artifacts, converts them to MP3, and updates an RSS feed you can subscribe to in any podcast app.

## Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- A domain pointing to your server (for HTTPS)

### 2. Get the files

**Option A — pre-built image (recommended)**

Download only the files needed to run:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurentftech/NoteCast/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurentftech/NoteCast/main/Caddyfile
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurentftech/NoteCast/main/.env.example
mkdir -p auth data public/episodes
```

Then edit `docker-compose.yml` and replace `build: ./bridge` with:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/laurentftech/notecast:latest
```

**Option B — build from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laurentftech/NoteCast.git
cd NoteCast
```

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
BASE_URL=https://podcast.yourdomain.com   # public URL of this server
CADDY_DOMAIN=podcast.yourdomain.com       # same host, no protocol
```

### 4. Authenticate with NotebookLM

Login requires a real browser window (Google OAuth). Run it on any machine that has a display — your Mac, a laptop, etc.

```bash
# One-time setup on your Mac
pip3.10 install notebooklm-py playwright
python3.10 -m playwright install chromium
notebooklm login
# A browser window opens → sign in with Google → closes automatically
```

Then push the credentials to the bridge (works locally or remotely over the network):

```bash
# If running locally
cp ~/.notebooklm/storage_state.json ./auth/

# If running on Synology or remote server
curl -X POST http://your-synology:8080/auth/upload \
     -F "file=@$HOME/.notebooklm/storage_state.json"
```

The bridge picks up the credentials immediately — no restart needed.

> **Tip:** set `BRIDGE_API_KEY` in `.env` to protect the upload endpoint. Then add `-H "X-Api-Key: yourkey"` to the curl command.

> **Tip:** back up `./auth/storage_state.json`. If lost, repeat this step.

### 5. Subscribe

Your feed is live at:

```
https://podcast.yourdomain.com/feed.xml
```

Paste this URL into Overcast, Pocket Casts, Apple Podcasts, or any RSS-capable app.

## Troubleshooting

**Bridge exits immediately**
```bash
docker compose logs notecast-bridge
```
Most likely: credentials missing. Follow step 3 above.

**Feed is empty**
- Check notebooks have audio overviews generated in NotebookLM
- `docker compose logs notecast-bridge` — look for "Processing new audio artifact"

**HTTPS not working**
- Verify `CADDY_DOMAIN` matches your DNS A record
- Ports 80 and 443 must be open on your firewall
